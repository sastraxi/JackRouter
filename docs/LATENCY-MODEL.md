# Latency model

End-to-end model of where time goes between the pi's IQaudIO codec and
the Mac's CoreAudio device, with every tunable named and its file/key
located. Pair with `JITTER.md` (where variance enters) and
`CLOCK_WARS.md` (why we have a resampler at all).

The chain is asymmetric: the Mac side is a single clock domain (clock
B), the Pi side has its own clock (clock A), and the cross-clock bridge
lives entirely in the Pi's `netadapter`. So tuning `netadapter` tunes
*the entire* cross-clock conversion.

---

## The picture

JackBridge is bidirectional but the two directions are *not symmetric*:
the IQaudIO codec (ADC + DAC) lives entirely on the pi. The Mac side
terminates at the DAW — no DAC in the model at all. So we draw the two
directions explicitly.

```

In both directions the **same single resampler** on the pi-side
netadapter bridges clock A ↔ the network-cycle clock (driven by Mac
clock B). Drift between A and B is absorbed by the netadapter slip ring
(G frames). Variance accumulates left-to-right in each direction — see
`JITTER.md` for the per-hop variance accounting.

## Latency contributions

Per-link, **monitoring path** (pi codec input → Mac → pi codec output)
with defaults at 48 kHz / Pi `-p 64` / Mac `PeriodFrames=64` / `-g 512`
/ `JitterFrames=256`. See "What this sum is" below for what to add or
subtract for other measurements (one-way recording, round-trip
loopback, etc.).

| Symbol | Stage | What it is | Frames | ms @ 48 k |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|
| T_adc  | Codec ADC          | Fixed group delay through the IQaudIO ADC | ~1 | ~0.02 |
| T_alsa | ALSA capture       | `period_size × nperiods` on the pi ALSA backend (`-p × -n`) | 128 | 2.67 |
| T_pj   | Pi jackd cycle     | One JACK period on the pi (`P_pi`) | 64 | 1.33 |
| T_g    | netadapter slip ring | Steady-state fill ≈ G/2 (controller targets midpoint) | 256 | 5.33 |
| T_l    | netadapter cycles  | Network latency in cycles (`-l N` → N · P_pi). **jack2 1.9.22 default = 2 cycles, max 30** (verified on-device via `Network latency : N cycles` log). | 128 | 2.67 |
| T_wire | UDP transit        | LAN one-way, direct cable. Dominated by NIC + switch fabric; sub-millisecond on a direct cable, ~0.5–1 ms through one consumer switch. | ~17 | ~0.35 |
| T_nm   | Mac netmanager     | One netjack cycle on the master side (≈ P_mac) | 64 | 1.33 |
| T_mj   | Mac jackd cycle    | One JACK period on the Mac (`PeriodFrames`) | 64 | 1.33 |
| T_d    | Daemon shm publish | memcpy + atomic release — nanoseconds, ignore | 0 | 0 |
| T_jf   | HAL safety lead    | `JitterFrames` — daemon writes this far ahead of HAL's read | 256 | 5.33 |
| T_dac  | Codec DAC          | Fixed group delay through the IQaudIO DAC | ~1 | ~0.02 |
| **Σ**  | **Monitoring trip** | Sum of all rows above                   | **979** | **20.4** |

### What this sum is

The 787-frame total represents the **monitoring path**: a signal that
enters the pi's ADC, traverses the whole chain to the Mac, and comes
back out the pi's DAC. This is what a guitarist hears when monitoring
through the Mac.

| Measurement scenario | What to do to Σ |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Monitoring** (in pi ADC → Mac → out pi DAC)  | Σ as-is = **787 frames / 16.4 ms** |
| **One-way recording** (pi ADC → Mac DAW, no return) | Σ − T_dac (drop the playback codec leg from `T_jf` onward; recording stops at HAL/DAW) |
| **One-way playback** (Mac DAW → pi DAC) | Σ − T_adc (no ADC at start; DAW source is digital) |
| **Pure-digital round-trip** (Mac plays signal → returns via JackBridge loopback, no codec) | ≈ 2 × (Σ − T_adc − T_dac) — both digital chains, no codec passes |
| **Hardware loopback round-trip** (pi DAC output cabled into pi ADC input) | ≈ 2 × Σ — full monitoring trip, twice |

Σ represents one full traversal in/out of the codec, which is the
useful unit for most listener-facing reasoning. The DAW's own internal
buffer (typically 128–512 frames) sits on top of all of these.

### Notes on the math

- **T_g uses G/2, not G.** The slip ring's controller resamples to keep
  fill near the midpoint; you only see the full G as headroom for
  bursts, not as steady-state latency. With `-g 512` that's 5.3 ms
  steady-state but 10.6 ms of burst tolerance.
- **T_alsa is the dominant pi-side audio buffer.** jackd's `-n 2` means
  ALSA holds 2 periods worth of frames before jackd sees them. The
  comment in `pistomp-arch/files/jackdrc:19` shows `-n 2` hardcoded.
- **T_l is not the same as T_wire.** `-l` is the number of *netjack
  cycles* of cushion the netadapter requests against network jitter,
  expressed in period-frames; T_wire is the actual UDP transit time on
  the wire. Both add up.
- **Round-trip latency** ≈ 2 · Σ if recording and monitoring through
  the Mac, but in practice DAW monitoring/effects sit between, so the
  RTT depends on your signal flow.

## Tunables — what to change and where

Ordered roughly by latency impact (biggest first), with the latency
delta you get per unit of change.

| Symbol | Knob | Where | Default | Impact on latency (frames per unit) |
|--------|------|-------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| G | netadapter ring size (`-g N`) | `pi/bin/jackbridge-pi-up:20` (deployed: `/usr/local/libexec/jackbridge/jackbridge-pi-up`) | `512` (was adaptive) | **0.5** — half a frame steady-state per ring frame; full frame in burst headroom |
| P_pi | Pi JACK period (`-p N`) | `/etc/default/jack` (`JACK_PERIOD`), seeded by `pistomp-arch/files/pistomp.conf:28` | `64` | T_pj scales 1:1, T_alsa scales N_pi:1, T_l scales L:1 — **the largest knob** |
| N_pi | ALSA periods (`-n N`) | `pistomp-arch/files/jackdrc:19` (hardcoded `-n 2`) | `2` | P_pi frames per period — biggest non-G one-shot saving if dropped to 1 (but risky) |
| L | netadapter network latency (`-l N`, cycles, range 0–30) | `pi/bin/jackbridge-pi-up:20` (currently unset → default) | `2` (jack2 1.9.22, verified on-device) | P_pi frames per cycle |
| P_mac | Mac JACK period (`PeriodFrames`) | `installer/config.plist:38` → `/Library/Application Support/JackBridge/config.plist` | `64` | T_mj scales 1:1; **must match P_pi or netJACK2 resampler chokes** |
| J | HAL safety lead (`JitterFrames`) | `installer/config.plist:48` | `256` | 1:1 — pure latency, no slip-ring effect (single clock domain) |
| f_s | Sample rate | `pistomp.conf:27` AND `installer/config.plist:31` | `48000` | All times are `frames / f_s`, so doubling f_s halves all ms costs but doubles CPU |
| Q | netadapter resampler quality (`-q N`, **0 = lowest, 4 = highest**) | `pi/bin/jackbridge-pi-up:20` | `0` (we set it explicitly) | No latency impact — only CPU/fidelity |
| MTU | netJACK MTU | `installer/config.plist:63` | `1500` | Affects T_wire only at jumbo-frame scale; only changes packet count, not buffer math |
| RT prio | jackd realtime priority | Pi: hardcoded `-P 75` in `jackdrc:19`. Mac: `RealtimePriority` in `config.plist:54` | `75` both | No direct latency; affects jitter (variance), not mean |
| Storm threshold | Auto-restart on xrun storm | `JACKBRIDGE_XRUN_THRESHOLD` env (read by `jackbridge-xrun-watcher`) | `50/s` | Recovers from degraded state; doesn't change steady-state latency |

### Knobs that DON'T affect latency

- `ClockDeviceUID` (`config.plist:27`) — picks *which* clock B is, not how the buffers are sized.
- `NetworkInterface` (`config.plist:73`) — routing, not buffering.
- `AutoConnect` block — wiring topology only.
- `Logging.Level` — observability only.

---

## How the knobs interact

A few non-obvious couplings:

### P_pi and P_mac must match

`config.plist:33-36` documents this and `CLOCK_WARS.md` explains why:
netJACK2's master/slave handshake expects equal cycle sizes. If they
differ, netadapter's resampler throws `WriteResample error` on cycle 1
and thrashes. So you tune them as a pair, not independently.

### G interacts with measured network jitter

`-g 512` ≈ 11 ms of burst tolerance. JITTER.md §5 measured network
inter-arrival p99=2.7 ms, max=13 ms. So an extreme burst can still
overflow this ring. With the auto-restart sentinel in place, that
becomes "3 s of audio dropout, then recovery" rather than "permanently
degraded ring size for the rest of the session." Pick G to suit your
tolerance:

| G (frames) | Steady (ms) | Burst tolerance (ms) | Trade |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| 256        | 2.67        | 5.33                 | **Current default.** Storm-restart is the safety net for the gap between this and measured network max (13 ms). |
| 512        | 5.33        | 10.6                 | Closer to measured p99 (2.7 ms) with ~4× headroom. |
| 1024       | 10.6        | 21.3                 | Comfortably above measured max jitter. |
| 2048       | 21.3        | 42.6                 | "Set and forget." |
| 4096       | 42.6        | 85.3                 | Studio session, no storm risk acceptable. |

### J (JitterFrames) is single-clock-domain only

Because the Mac is one clock end-to-end (CLOCK_WARS.md "where the SRC
actually lives"), J doesn't need a controller — it's just a constant
lead. Sizing it is purely about absorbing thread scheduling jitter on
the Mac (`docs/idiosyncrasies.md` — daemon's JACK thread vs HAL's IO
proc), not clock drift. If you ever broke the same-clock assumption
(e.g. ran jackd on a different physical device than `ClockDeviceUID`
selected), J would need to grow to slip-ring proportions or you'd need
to add SRC on the Mac — which `CLAUDE.md` explicitly forbids.

### Q is free latency-wise but not CPU-wise

`-q` only changes resampler quality (filter taps). Lower Q = cheaper Pi
CPU; we've set `-q 0` because (a) we can't be bit-exact anyway so
fidelity past "inaudible" is wasted (`CLOCK_WARS.md`) and (b) freeing
Pi CPU helps the netadapter cycle hit its budget under mod-host load.

## Quick recipes

All Σ figures are **monitoring trip** (pi ADC → Mac → pi DAC).

**Current defaults (post-recent-changes):**
- `-g 256`, `-q 0`, `JACK_PERIOD=64`, `PeriodFrames=64`, `JitterFrames=192`.
- Σ = **787 frames / 16.4 ms**. Storm-restart sentinel is the safety net.

**One more notch of shave (low-risk, JitterFrames-only):**
- Same as above but `JitterFrames=128`.
- Σ = **723 frames / 15.1 ms**. JITTER.md §2 puts worst-case Mac scheduling at ~75 frames so 128 leaves ~70% headroom.

**"Sounds good every time," more latency:**
- `-g 4096`, `JACK_PERIOD=128`, `PeriodFrames=128`, `JitterFrames=256`, `-q 0`.
- Σ ≈ **3220 frames / 67 ms**. Storm-restart should never fire.

**Diagnose where latency lives in YOUR setup:**
- Send a known transient (handclap, click track) from DAW to pi headphones, record back.
- The recorded delay is the monitoring trip ≈ Σ + your DAW's monitoring path latency.
- Bisect by changing one knob at a time and re-measuring.

## Where these numbers come from

- T_alsa, T_pj, T_mj, T_nm are from the JACK / ALSA buffer math (frames ÷ sample rate).
- T_g midpoint behavior is documented in jack2's `JackAudioAdapter::PushAndPull` — the controller targets midpoint via the resampler ratio.
- T_jf reasoning is in `installer/config.plist:40-48` and `docs/architecture.md`.
- Network latency default (`-l 2`, max 30) verified on the live pi by loading netadapter under a probe client name and reading the `Network latency : N cycles` line from `journalctl -u jack` (jack2 1.9.22 on Arch).
- T_adc / T_dac are codec group-delay values from the IQaudIO datasheet (low ms).
- ms numbers are computed for 48 kHz; scale for other rates.
